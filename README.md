# Brewer color palettes for GIMP

A simple Python program which creates Brewer color palettes for GIMP.

Reads a .txt palette file from http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/brewer/ and converts the different color palettes into a folder which can be copied into GIMP's palette directory.

Developed on a Debian system in January 2014.
